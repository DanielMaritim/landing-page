       <h1>I am an Elephant</h1>
       <p>The African elephant is a genus comprising two living elephant species, the African bush elephant and the smaller
    African forest elephant. Both are herbivores and live in groups. They have grey skin and differ in the size of their
    ears and tusks, and in the shape and size of their skulls.</p>

       <p>Males usually stay with a female and her herd for about a month before moving on in search for another mate. Less than a
    third of the population of female elephants will be in estrus at any given time and gestation period of an elephant is
    long, so it makes more evolutionary sense for a male to search for as many females as possible rather than stay with one
    group.</p>
